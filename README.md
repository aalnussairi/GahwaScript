# GahwaScript

## What Is It?

It's the arabic version of JavaScript. It works on browsers by compiling GahwaScript to JavaScript.

## Current Progress

Working on translating core WebAPIs. Perhaps the Window API first and any APIs it depends on (Storage API for example).

Also setup a basic tokenizer for the parser.

Once I have these two running to a limited degree I'll refactor for maintainability and begin working on generating ASTs.

## Future Plans

Translate ECMAScript 2015 standard to Arabic
Translate core JavaScript utilities to Arabic.
Translate some the math standard language to Arabic.
Understand how the TypeScript Compiler and Babel works.
